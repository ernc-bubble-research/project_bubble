# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# PHASE SCOPE:
# ============
# Prototype (Phase 1): Epics 1-7 (7 epics, stories updated 2026-02-02 for architectural pivot)
# Phase 2 / Future:    Epics 8, 9, 10, 11 (4 epics, 10 stories)
#
# DEPENDENCY CHAIN:
# Epic 1 → Epic 1H (hardening) → Epic 2 + Epic 3 (parallel) → Epic 4 → Epic 5 → Epic 6
# Epic 7 runs parallel to Epics 4-6
#
# GATE REQUIREMENTS:
# ==================
# BEFORE Epic 3: Run /bmad:bmm:workflows:quick-spec for Workflow Definition Schema.
#   (UPDATED 2026-02-01: LangGraph.js DEFERRED — replaced by LLM-orchestrated execution)
#   Scope: YAML workflow schema for atomic workflows, input role taxonomy (context vs subject),
#   execution patterns (fan-out parallel, fan-in batch), workflow chain composition,
#   output spec and structural validation, context window token budget check.
#   Rationale: Epic 3 builds the UI that PRODUCES YAML workflow definitions; Epic 4 builds
#   the engine that CONSUMES them. The YAML schema contract must be defined first so the
#   form builder produces exactly what the execution engine needs. No rework.
#   This tech spec MUST be completed before any Epic 3 story is created.
#
# BEFORE Epic 4 Story 4.1 or 4.2: Build Mock LLM Provider alongside real providers.
#   The architecture specifies a Hexagonal LLM pattern (abstract provider interface).
#   - MockLlmProvider: Returns deterministic canned responses. Free, instant, for dev + unit tests.
#   - VertexLlmProvider: Real Google Vertex AI calls (paid). For production.
#   - GoogleAIStudioProvider: Free tier Google AI Studio API. For smoke tests + dev validation.
#   - Switched via LLM_PROVIDER env var (mock | google-ai-studio | vertex).
#   - Create a "smoke test" workflow (2 steps, 1-2 small docs) for real LLM validation.
#   - Mock provider covers engine logic (graph execution, state, retries, feedback loop).
#   - Google AI Studio (free tier) for real LLM integration testing without cost.
#   - Vertex AI for production workloads.
#   LLM TESTING STRATEGY:
#   - 90% development: MockLlmProvider (free, deterministic, fast)
#   - 10% validation: GoogleAIStudioProvider (free tier, real LLM responses)
#   - Production: VertexLlmProvider (paid, scalable)
#
# AFTER MVP Delivery (Epics 1-7 complete):
#   1. Implement Husky git pre-push hook (nx affected:test + nx affected:lint).
#      Rationale: BMAD workflow already runs full lint/test/build on every story,
#      but Husky adds a safety net for any future non-BMAD pushes.
#   2. Story 1.11: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (GitHub Actions).
#   3. Docker Compose for local full-stack orchestration.
#   4. Production deployment (cloud hosting, migrations, secrets management).
#
# DEFERRED DECISIONS:
# ===================
# - Story 1.11 (CI/CD) deferred to post-MVP. BMAD workflow provides equivalent
#   lint/test/build verification on every story. Solo dev, no PR workflow yet.
# - Story 1.12 (Invitations) story created, ready-for-dev. Not blocking Epic 2/3.
# - MVP runs entirely on laptop: Angular + NestJS + Postgres (Docker) + Redis (Docker) + Vertex AI API key.
# - synchronize:true for dev. Switch to TypeORM migrations before production deployment.
#
# DEFERRED TO PHASE 2: KNOWLEDGE BASE FEATURES (Epic 3 Retro Item #8)
# ====================================================================
# Decision: Knowledge base features (RAG, semantic search integration with workflows)
# are deferred to Phase 2. This includes:
#   - Wizard knowledge step (removed from workflow-wizard.component.ts)
#   - Knowledge source selection UI for workflows
#   - RAG-powered workflow inputs
# The backend code (Stories 2-2, 2-3, 2-4) remains intact but is not used in MVP.
# Workflows will use file uploads from Data Vault as inputs, not RAG search.
# Raised during Epic 3 retrospective (2026-02-04).
#
# DEFERRED: DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH HARDENING
# =====================================
# Story 2.4 code review (M3): Some raw SQL queries (e.g., getByRun) rely on RLS alone
# for tenant scoping without explicit tenant_id in WHERE clause. While safe due to RLS,
# adding explicit tenant_id provides defense-in-depth. This should be applied holistically
# across ALL raw SQL in the codebase (knowledge-search, validated-insight, ingestion)
# as a dedicated hardening story rather than piecemeal. Add to Epic 7 or a future
# hardening sprint.
# Raised during Story 2.4 code review (2026-02-01).
#
# RETRO NOTE: RECURRING tenantId OMISSION IN WHERE CLAUSES
# =========================================================
# This is a RECURRING pattern across multiple stories and epics:
# - Story 2.4 code review: raw SQL queries missing tenant_id (M3)
# - Story 3.3 code review: H3 — findOne queries missing tenantId defense-in-depth
# - Story 3.4 code review: H1/H2 — WorkflowVersionsService had THREE methods missing
#   tenantId in WHERE clauses (createVersion, findAllByTemplate, findOne)
# ROOT CAUSE: Dev agent consistently writes queries with only the primary key (id)
# and omits tenantId from WHERE clauses, relying on RLS alone. Code review catches
# it every time, but it should not be happening in the first place.
# ACTION: This pattern must be added to project-context.md as a CRITICAL rule so
# that dev agents include tenantId in EVERY WHERE clause by default. The rule should
# be: "ALL TypeORM findOne/find/update/delete WHERE clauses on tenant-scoped entities
# MUST include tenantId alongside any other conditions. No exceptions."
# Raised during Story 3.4 code review (2026-02-02).

# RETRO NOTE: END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE IS ZERO
# ==============================================
# Despite 555+ unit tests passing across all projects, the UI is largely
# non-functional in the browser. Root causes discovered during Story 3.2 review:
#
# 1. UNIT TESTS MOCK EVERYTHING: All HTTP calls use provideHttpClientTesting()
#    or jest mocks. Tests verify component logic in isolation but never hit
#    a real API. 555 tests can pass while the actual app returns 500 on every endpoint.
#
# 2. API GATEWAY CRASHES ON STARTUP: TypeORM entities (WorkflowRunEntity,
#    WorkflowChainEntity, KnowledgeChunkEntity) were never registered via
#    forFeature(), so autoLoadEntities:true never created their tables.
#    RlsSetupService crashes trying to enable RLS on missing tables.
#    This was NEVER caught because no e2e or integration test starts the server.
#
# 3. CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY IN LAZY ROUTES: unsaved-changes.guard.ts statically
#    imported HasUnsavedChanges from workflow-wizard.component.ts, breaking
#    Vite's chunk splitting. The "Create Workflow" button silently failed.
#    Unit tests don't test lazy loading or chunk resolution.
#
# 4. SETTINGS PAGE DOESN'T EXIST: Navigation sidebar links to /admin/settings
#    but no route or component exists. Zero tests catch this because no e2e
#    test exercises navigation.
#
# ACTION REQUIRED: Create end-to-end tests starting from Epic 1 for ALL epics.
# E2E tests must verify:
#   - API gateway starts without errors
#   - All navigation routes resolve to real components
#   - API endpoints return expected responses (not just 500)
#   - Authentication flow works end-to-end
#   - CRUD operations complete round-trips (UI → API → DB → API → UI)
#
# QUALITY PROCESS FAILURES:
#   - "MVP quality" was used as an excuse to skip integration testing
#   - 81 lint warnings were hidden across the codebase (Epic 1)
#   - Step validation in workflow wizard was completely bypassed (nextStep(true)
#     hardcoded) — equivalent to "forgot to implement a story"
#   - Entity registration gaps went undetected for 3+ epics because unit tests
#     never exercise the TypeORM connection
#
# ADDITIONAL PRE-EXISTING ISSUE: PGVECTOR COLUMN TYPE WRONG SINCE EPIC 2
# The knowledge_chunks.embedding column was created as float8[] (TypeORM default)
# instead of vector(768) (pgvector type). This means:
#   - HNSW index for fast cosine similarity search was NEVER created
#   - All similarity searches do sequential scans (O(n) instead of O(log n))
#   - The warning "operator class vector_cosine_ops does not accept data type
#     double precision[]" appeared on EVERY server startup and was ignored
# Fix applied: RlsSetupService now ALTERs the column to vector(768) on startup.
# This was never caught because:
#   a) Unit tests mock the database
#   b) No integration test verifies actual pgvector queries
#   c) The search "worked" (PostgreSQL casts on-the-fly) so nobody noticed
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# This is the #1 priority action item for the retrospective.
# Raised during Story 3.2 code review and UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# RETRO NOTE: LOGOUT BUTTON UX — TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER
# =====================================================
# Current logout button in admin sidebar footer is a plain text button.
# Planned redesign: replace with user avatar dropdown menu (click avatar → dropdown
# with profile info, settings, and logout). This should apply to ALL layout components
# (admin-layout and app-layout) for all user roles (bubble_admin, tenant users).
# The current ugly standalone button should be removed once the avatar dropdown is built.
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# RETRO NOTE: ADDITIONAL RUNTIME BUGS FOUND DURING UI TESTING
# ============================================================
# 1. Tags input comma bug: metadata step's ngOnChanges → populateFromState() re-patched
#    the tags form control from parent state on every keystroke. Since syncToParent()
#    splits on comma and filters empty strings, typing a comma immediately triggers
#    a round-trip that strips the trailing comma. User could never type commas.
# 2. Markdown output sections error: "Cannot find control with name: '0'" —
#    formArrayName="sections" was missing on the sections container div.
#    [formGroupName]="i" tried to resolve against root form group instead of FormArray.
# Both bugs were invisible to unit tests (mocked forms, no real DOM interaction).
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# END-OF-EPIC DISCUSSION ITEMS (collected during Epic 3 UI testing)
# =================================================================
# The following items were raised by the user during hands-on UI testing and
# must be discussed at the end of this epic for planning/prioritization:
#
# 1. LOGOUT BUTTON UX: Replace standalone text button with user avatar dropdown
#    menu. Applies to all layouts (admin + app) and all roles.
#
# 2. WORKFLOW VISIBILITY UI: Backend supports public/private/restricted +
#    allowed_tenants, but the workflow wizard has no UI for these fields.
#    Need to add visibility controls to the wizard or a separate management view.
#
# 3. TENANT LIFECYCLE: Add archive/suspend state for churned tenants.
#    Add hard-delete option for archived tenants (GDPR/data privacy compliance).
#    Currently only create/read/update exists — no archive or delete.
#
# 4. SETTINGS PAGE (REQUIRED): Admin Settings page must be built. Key features:
#    - LLM model management: add new models to existing providers, edit/deactivate
#      models, configure provider credentials (Google AI Studio, Vertex, etc.)
#    - System-level configuration (future: email templates, feature flags, etc.)
#    The nav link was removed because it pointed to 404 with no backing component.
#    Must be re-added once the settings feature is implemented.
#
# 5. E2E TEST COVERAGE: Create end-to-end tests starting from Epic 1 for all
#    epics. This is the #1 priority action item (see detailed note above).
#
# 6. STORY SIZING: Story 3.2 was too large (6-step wizard + all UI components),
#    leading to many bugs and extended review cycle. Enforce smaller, more
#    focused stories going forward to reduce risk and improve quality.
#
# 7. UI POLISH PASS: Several UI components look rough/ugly. Need a dedicated
#    polish pass to improve visual consistency, spacing, and overall UX.
#
# 8. KNOWLEDGE BASE INTEGRATION UX: The wizard has a knowledge toggle step but
#    we haven't designed how users actually attach/select knowledge sources to
#    a workflow. Need to define the UX for linking indexed assets to workflows.
#
# 9. WORKFLOW WIZARD DOCUMENTATION: Create a user guide explaining each wizard
#    step, field names, variable syntax ({subject_name}, {timestamp}, etc.),
#    input roles (subject vs context), and expected values so the product can
#    be properly tested end-to-end.
#
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02, 2026-02-04).
#
# RETRO NOTE: QUALITY REGRESSION SINCE EPIC 2 RETROSPECTIVE
# ==========================================================
# Despite the Epic 2 retrospective identifying process failures and defining
# action items, quality has REGRESSED rather than improved. Examples from
# Story 3.6b review (2026-02-04):
#
# 1. SHALLOW ANALYSIS: When reviewing Story 3.6b, suggested deferring AC 14
#    (intermediate outputs visibility) without analyzing the business impact.
#    This feature is CRITICAL for fairness — users pay credits for each workflow
#    in a chain and MUST see all outputs they paid for. Deferral was lazy, not
#    a legitimate scope decision.
#
# 2. ROUTE INCONSISTENCY: Story specified `/admin/workflow-studio/chains/new`
#    but existing routes use `/admin/workflows/`. Basic codebase verification
#    was not performed before writing the story.
#
# 3. INTERFACE MISMATCH: Story task listed input source options that don't match
#    the actual ChainInputSource interface. Copy-paste assumptions instead of
#    reading the actual code.
#
# 4. MISSING DEPENDENCIES: Story required fetching published templates but
#    WorkflowTemplateService.getAll() doesn't exist. Dependencies not verified.
#
# ROOT CAUSE: The agent is optimizing for speed over correctness. Story creation
# is becoming a checkbox exercise rather than thorough technical analysis.
# The user should NOT have to babysit every decision.
#
# ACTION REQUIRED:
# - Story review must include VERIFICATION against actual codebase (routes,
#   interfaces, services, DTOs) before marking ready-for-dev
# - "Defer" recommendations require explicit business impact analysis
# - Quality bar from Epic 2 retro MUST be enforced, not ignored
#
# Raised during Story 3.6b review (2026-02-04).

# IMMEDIATE POST-EPIC-2 ACTION:
# =============================
# - Swagger @ApiResponse gap fix: Add missing error response decorators (400, 401, 403, 500)
#   to ALL existing controllers across Epic 1 and Epic 2. Rule added to project-context.md
#   to prevent this gap in all future epics. Must be done before Epic 3 starts.
#   Controllers to fix: AuthController, TenantsController, UsersController,
#   InvitationsController, AssetsController, FoldersController, IngestionController,
#   KnowledgeController, AppController.
#   Raised during Story 2.3 code review (2026-02-01).
#
# FUTURE EPIC CONSIDERATION:
# ==========================
# - Knowledge Base Browsing/Viewing UI: Admin and tenant-facing UI to browse stored
#   RAG data (indexed chunks, embeddings metadata), search the knowledge base interactively,
#   and view per-tenant knowledge health. Could be part of Epic 8 or a new epic.
#   Raised during Story 2.3 creation (2026-02-01).
