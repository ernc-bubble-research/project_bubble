# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# PHASE SCOPE:
# ============
# Prototype (Phase 1): Epics 1-7 + 7P (production readiness)
# Phase 2 / Future:    Epics 8, 9, 10, 11 (4 epics, 10 stories)
#
# DEPENDENCY CHAIN (updated 2026-02-05 after Architect Review):
# Epic 1 → Epic 1H → Epic 2 + Epic 3 (parallel) → Epic 3.1 → Epic 4 → Epic 5 → Epic 6
# Epic 7 runs parallel to Epics 4-6
# Epic 7P (Production Readiness) runs parallel to Epics 4-6, must complete before production
#
# RECOMMENDED EXECUTION ORDER (updated 2026-02-05 after Architect Review):
# 1. Story 3H  — RxJS Subscription Cleanup (CRITICAL - memory leaks) ✓ DONE

#    f. 7P-6 RLS auth bypass security review + hardening
#    g. 7P-7 Load testing + capacity planning
#
# GATE REQUIREMENTS:
# ==================
# BEFORE Epic 3: Run /bmad:bmm:workflows:quick-spec for Workflow Definition Schema.
#   (UPDATED 2026-02-01: LangGraph.js DEFERRED — replaced by LLM-orchestrated execution)
#   Scope: YAML workflow schema for atomic workflows, input role taxonomy (context vs subject),
#   execution patterns (fan-out parallel, fan-in batch), workflow chain composition,
#   output spec and structural validation, context window token budget check.
#   Rationale: Epic 3 builds the UI that PRODUCES YAML workflow definitions; Epic 4 builds
#   the engine that CONSUMES them. The YAML schema contract must be defined first so the
#   form builder produces exactly what the execution engine needs. No rework.
#   This tech spec MUST be completed before any Epic 3 story is created.
#
# BEFORE Epic 4 Story 4.1 or 4.2: Build Mock LLM Provider alongside real providers.
#   The architecture specifies a Hexagonal LLM pattern (abstract provider interface).
#   - MockLlmProvider: Returns deterministic canned responses. Free, instant, for dev + unit tests.
#   - VertexLlmProvider: Real Google Vertex AI calls (paid). For production.
#   - GoogleAIStudioProvider: Free tier Google AI Studio API. For smoke tests + dev validation.
#   - Switched via LLM_PROVIDER env var (mock | google-ai-studio | vertex).
#   - Create a "smoke test" workflow (2 steps, 1-2 small docs) for real LLM validation.
#   - Mock provider covers engine logic (graph execution, state, retries, feedback loop).
#   - Google AI Studio (free tier) for real LLM integration testing without cost.
#   - Vertex AI for production workloads.
#   LLM TESTING STRATEGY:
#   - 90% development: MockLlmProvider (free, deterministic, fast)
#   - 10% validation: GoogleAIStudioProvider (free tier, real LLM responses)
#   - Production: VertexLlmProvider (paid, scalable)
#
# BEFORE Production Deployment (CRITICAL — from Architect Review 2026-02-05):
#   All items in Epic 7P must be completed. Key decisions required:
#   1. Deployment target: GCP (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL) vs AWS vs Render/Railway
#      - GCP implied by Vertex AI/Gemini dependency. Cascades to all infra choices.
#   2. File storage: Must migrate from local filesystem to cloud object storage.
#      - Current: uploads/<tenantId>/<uuid>-<filename> on local disk (not production-safe)
#      - AssetEntity.storage_path is a relative path — migration is swap-backend, keep-format
#   3. Secrets management: Must replace .env files with cloud secrets manager.
#      - Sensitive: JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY, SMTP_PASS
#      - No rotation, no encryption at rest, no audit trail currently
#   4. Database backups: No automated backup exists.
#      - docker compose down -v destroys all data
#      - Need pg_dump automation or managed DB with PITR
#   5. BullMQ hardening: No DLQ, no circuit breaker, no alerting on job failures.
#      - Safety-critical subset (DLQ + idempotency) moved to Epic 4 Story 4.0
#      - Remaining (circuit breaker, alerting) stays in 7P-5 for pre-production
#   6. RLS auth bypass policies: Permissive SELECT true on users/invitations tables.
#      - By design for pre-auth flows, but needs security review
#      - Consider dedicated DB roles to restrict access scope
#   7. Load testing: Zero performance benchmarks exist.
#      - PRD targets: <200ms UI, <2s submission ack, <3s report render
#      - Need capacity planning: ~150 tenants, 1500 users estimated from revenue targets
#   8. TypeORM synchronize:true must be replaced with migrations
#   9. CI/CD pipeline (Story 1.11)
#
# AFTER MVP Delivery (Epics 1-7 + 7P complete):
#   1. Implement Husky git pre-push hook (nx affected:test + nx affected:lint).
#      Rationale: BMAD workflow already runs full lint/test/build on every story,
#      but Husky adds a safety net for any future non-BMAD pushes.
#
# DEFERRED DECISIONS:
# ===================
# - Story 1.11 (CI/CD) deferred to post-MVP. BMAD workflow provides equivalent
#   lint/test/build verification on every story. Solo dev, no PR workflow yet.
# - Story 1.12 (Invitations) story created, ready-for-dev. Not blocking Epic 2/3.
# - MVP runs entirely on laptop: Angular + NestJS + Postgres (Docker) + Redis (Docker) + Vertex AI API key.
# - synchronize:true for dev. Switch to TypeORM migrations before production deployment.
# - Production infrastructure decisions (cloud provider, file storage, secrets, backups)
#   now tracked in Epic 7P (created 2026-02-05 from Architect Review findings).
#
# DEFERRED TO PHASE 2: KNOWLEDGE BASE FEATURES (Epic 3 Retro Item #8)
# ====================================================================
# Decision: Knowledge base features (RAG, semantic search integration with workflows)
# are deferred to Phase 2. This includes:
#   - Wizard knowledge step (removed from workflow-wizard.component.ts)
#   - Knowledge source selection UI for workflows
#   - RAG-powered workflow inputs
# The backend code (Stories 2-2, 2-3, 2-4) remains intact but is not used in MVP.
# Workflows will use file uploads from Data Vault as inputs, not RAG search.
# Raised during Epic 3 retrospective (2026-02-04).
#
# DEFERRED: DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH HARDENING
# =====================================
# Story 2.4 code review (M3): Some raw SQL queries (e.g., getByRun) rely on RLS alone
# for tenant scoping without explicit tenant_id in WHERE clause. While safe due to RLS,
# adding explicit tenant_id provides defense-in-depth. This should be applied holistically
# across ALL raw SQL in the codebase (knowledge-search, validated-insight, ingestion)
# as a dedicated hardening story rather than piecemeal. Add to Epic 7 or a future
# hardening sprint.
# Raised during Story 2.4 code review (2026-02-01).
#
# RETRO NOTE: RECURRING tenantId OMISSION IN WHERE CLAUSES
# =========================================================
# This is a RECURRING pattern across multiple stories and epics:
# - Story 2.4 code review: raw SQL queries missing tenant_id (M3)
# - Story 3.3 code review: H3 — findOne queries missing tenantId defense-in-depth
# - Story 3.4 code review: H1/H2 — WorkflowVersionsService had THREE methods missing
#   tenantId in WHERE clauses (createVersion, findAllByTemplate, findOne)
# ROOT CAUSE: Dev agent consistently writes queries with only the primary key (id)
# and omits tenantId from WHERE clauses, relying on RLS alone. Code review catches
# it every time, but it should not be happening in the first place.
# ACTION: This pattern must be added to project-context.md as a CRITICAL rule so
# that dev agents include tenantId in EVERY WHERE clause by default. The rule should
# be: "ALL TypeORM findOne/find/update/delete WHERE clauses on tenant-scoped entities
# MUST include tenantId alongside any other conditions. No exceptions."
# Raised during Story 3.4 code review (2026-02-02).

# RETRO NOTE: END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE IS ZERO
# ==============================================
# Despite 555+ unit tests passing across all projects, the UI is largely
# non-functional in the browser. Root causes discovered during Story 3.2 review:
#
# 1. UNIT TESTS MOCK EVERYTHING: All HTTP calls use provideHttpClientTesting()
#    or jest mocks. Tests verify component logic in isolation but never hit
#    a real API. 555 tests can pass while the actual app returns 500 on every endpoint.
#
# 2. API GATEWAY CRASHES ON STARTUP: TypeORM entities (WorkflowRunEntity,
#    WorkflowChainEntity, KnowledgeChunkEntity) were never registered via
#    forFeature(), so autoLoadEntities:true never created their tables.
#    RlsSetupService crashes trying to enable RLS on missing tables.
#    This was NEVER caught because no e2e or integration test starts the server.
#
# 3. CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY IN LAZY ROUTES: unsaved-changes.guard.ts statically
#    imported HasUnsavedChanges from workflow-wizard.component.ts, breaking
#    Vite's chunk splitting. The "Create Workflow" button silently failed.
#    Unit tests don't test lazy loading or chunk resolution.
#
# 4. SETTINGS PAGE DOESN'T EXIST: Navigation sidebar links to /admin/settings
#    but no route or component exists. Zero tests catch this because no e2e
#    test exercises navigation.
#
# ACTION REQUIRED: Create end-to-end tests starting from Epic 1 for ALL epics.
# E2E tests must verify:
#   - API gateway starts without errors
#   - All navigation routes resolve to real components
#   - API endpoints return expected responses (not just 500)
#   - Authentication flow works end-to-end
#   - CRUD operations complete round-trips (UI → API → DB → API → UI)
#
# QUALITY PROCESS FAILURES:
#   - "MVP quality" was used as an excuse to skip integration testing
#   - 81 lint warnings were hidden across the codebase (Epic 1)
#   - Step validation in workflow wizard was completely bypassed (nextStep(true)
#     hardcoded) — equivalent to "forgot to implement a story"
#   - Entity registration gaps went undetected for 3+ epics because unit tests
#     never exercise the TypeORM connection
#
# ADDITIONAL PRE-EXISTING ISSUE: PGVECTOR COLUMN TYPE WRONG SINCE EPIC 2
# The knowledge_chunks.embedding column was created as float8[] (TypeORM default)
# instead of vector(768) (pgvector type). This means:
#   - HNSW index for fast cosine similarity search was NEVER created
#   - All similarity searches do sequential scans (O(n) instead of O(log n))
#   - The warning "operator class vector_cosine_ops does not accept data type
#     double precision[]" appeared on EVERY server startup and was ignored
# Fix applied: RlsSetupService now ALTERs the column to vector(768) on startup.
# This was never caught because:
#   a) Unit tests mock the database
#   b) No integration test verifies actual pgvector queries
#   c) The search "worked" (PostgreSQL casts on-the-fly) so nobody noticed
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# This is the #1 priority action item for the retrospective.
# Raised during Story 3.2 code review and UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# RETRO NOTE: LOGOUT BUTTON UX — TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER
# =====================================================
# Current logout button in admin sidebar footer is a plain text button.
# Planned redesign: replace with user avatar dropdown menu (click avatar → dropdown
# with profile info, settings, and logout). This should apply to ALL layout components
# (admin-layout and app-layout) for all user roles (bubble_admin, tenant users).
# The current ugly standalone button should be removed once the avatar dropdown is built.
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# RETRO NOTE: ADDITIONAL RUNTIME BUGS FOUND DURING UI TESTING
# ============================================================
# 1. Tags input comma bug: metadata step's ngOnChanges → populateFromState() re-patched
#    the tags form control from parent state on every keystroke. Since syncToParent()
#    splits on comma and filters empty strings, typing a comma immediately triggers
#    a round-trip that strips the trailing comma. User could never type commas.
# 2. Markdown output sections error: "Cannot find control with name: '0'" —
#    formArrayName="sections" was missing on the sections container div.
#    [formGroupName]="i" tried to resolve against root form group instead of FormArray.
# Both bugs were invisible to unit tests (mocked forms, no real DOM interaction).
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02).
#
# END-OF-EPIC DISCUSSION ITEMS (collected during Epic 3 UI testing)
# =================================================================
# The following items were raised by the user during hands-on UI testing and
# must be discussed at the end of this epic for planning/prioritization:
#
# 1. LOGOUT BUTTON UX: Replace standalone text button with user avatar dropdown
#    menu. Applies to all layouts (admin + app) and all roles.
#
# 2. WORKFLOW VISIBILITY UI: Backend supports public/private/restricted +
#    allowed_tenants, but the workflow wizard has no UI for these fields.
#    Need to add visibility controls to the wizard or a separate management view.
#
# 3. TENANT LIFECYCLE: Add archive/suspend state for churned tenants.
#    Add hard-delete option for archived tenants (GDPR/data privacy compliance).
#    Currently only create/read/update exists — no archive or delete.
#
# 4. SETTINGS PAGE (REQUIRED): Admin Settings page must be built. Key features:
#    - LLM model management: add new models to existing providers, edit/deactivate
#      models, configure provider credentials (Google AI Studio, Vertex, etc.)
#    - System-level configuration (future: email templates, feature flags, etc.)
#    The nav link was removed because it pointed to 404 with no backing component.
#    Must be re-added once the settings feature is implemented.
#
# 5. E2E TEST COVERAGE: Create end-to-end tests starting from Epic 1 for all
#    epics. This is the #1 priority action item (see detailed note above).
#
# 6. STORY SIZING: Story 3.2 was too large (6-step wizard + all UI components),
#    leading to many bugs and extended review cycle. Enforce smaller, more
#    focused stories going forward to reduce risk and improve quality.
#
# 7. UI POLISH PASS: Several UI components look rough/ugly. Need a dedicated
#    polish pass to improve visual consistency, spacing, and overall UX.
#
# 8. KNOWLEDGE BASE INTEGRATION UX: The wizard has a knowledge toggle step but
#    we haven't designed how users actually attach/select knowledge sources to
#    a workflow. Need to define the UX for linking indexed assets to workflows.
#
# 9. WORKFLOW WIZARD DOCUMENTATION: Create a user guide explaining each wizard
#    step, field names, variable syntax ({subject_name}, {timestamp}, etc.),
#    input roles (subject vs context), and expected values so the product can
#    be properly tested end-to-end.
#
# Raised during Story 3.2 UI testing (2026-02-02, 2026-02-04).
#
# RETRO NOTE: QUALITY REGRESSION SINCE EPIC 2 RETROSPECTIVE
# ==========================================================
# Despite the Epic 2 retrospective identifying process failures and defining
# action items, quality has REGRESSED rather than improved. Examples from
# Story 3.6b review (2026-02-04):
#
# 1. SHALLOW ANALYSIS: When reviewing Story 3.6b, suggested deferring AC 14
#    (intermediate outputs visibility) without analyzing the business impact.
#    This feature is CRITICAL for fairness — users pay credits for each workflow
#    in a chain and MUST see all outputs they paid for. Deferral was lazy, not
#    a legitimate scope decision.
#
# 2. ROUTE INCONSISTENCY: Story specified `/admin/workflow-studio/chains/new`
#    but existing routes use `/admin/workflows/`. Basic codebase verification
#    was not performed before writing the story.
#
# 3. INTERFACE MISMATCH: Story task listed input source options that don't match
#    the actual ChainInputSource interface. Copy-paste assumptions instead of
#    reading the actual code.
#
# 4. MISSING DEPENDENCIES: Story required fetching published templates but
#    WorkflowTemplateService.getAll() doesn't exist. Dependencies not verified.
#
# ROOT CAUSE: The agent is optimizing for speed over correctness. Story creation
# is becoming a checkbox exercise rather than thorough technical analysis.
# The user should NOT have to babysit every decision.
#
# ACTION REQUIRED:
# - Story review must include VERIFICATION against actual codebase (routes,
#   interfaces, services, DTOs) before marking ready-for-dev
# - "Defer" recommendations require explicit business impact analysis
# - Quality bar from Epic 2 retro MUST be enforced, not ignored
#
# Raised during Story 3.6b review (2026-02-04).

# ARCHITECT REVIEW FINDINGS (2026-02-05)
# =======================================
# A comprehensive Architect Review Package was generated scanning ALL BMAD docs,
# the full codebase, and all planning artifacts. Seven critical production-readiness
# gaps were identified and captured in Epic 7P (Production Readiness):
#
# CRITICAL (blocks production deployment):
#   1. NO DEPLOYMENT TARGET: Only local docker-compose exists. No cloud provider chosen.
#      Architecture.md mentions Render/Railway/AppRunner but no decision made. GCP implied
#      by Vertex AI/Gemini dependency. This decision cascades to ALL other infra choices.
#   2. NO FILE STORAGE STRATEGY: Uploaded files stored on local disk (uploads/<tenantId>/).
#      Lost on container restart. No horizontal scaling. No backup. Not production-safe.
#   3. NO SECRETS MANAGEMENT: 6 sensitive env vars in .env files. No rotation, no encryption
#      at rest, no audit trail. Cloud secrets manager required.
#   4. NO BACKUP/DR: docker compose down -v destroys everything. No pg_dump, no PITR,
#      no file backup. Knowledge Base snapshots deferred as [Future] in architecture.
#
# HIGH (blocks safe Epic 4 execution):
#   5. NO ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY: BullMQ ingestion has basic retry (3 attempts, exp backoff)
#      but no DLQ, no circuit breaker, no alerting. Before Epic 4 (real LLM calls with
#      credit charges), need idempotency + failure recovery for charged operations.
#   6. RLS AUTH BYPASS RED FLAG: auth_select_all on users table uses condition:true.
#      Any DB connection without tenant context can read ALL users (emails, password hashes).
#      Intentional for pre-auth flow but needs formal security review and risk acceptance
#      or mitigation (dedicated DB roles).
#   7. NO PERFORMANCE TARGETS VALIDATED: PRD has NFRs (<200ms UI, <2s submission, <3s report)
#      but zero load tests exist. No capacity planning. Revenue target implies ~150 tenants
#      / 1500 users but no infra sizing done.
#
# DOCUMENT: _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architect-review-package.md
# ACTION: Epic 7P created with 7 stories to address these gaps.
# TIMING: BullMQ safety-critical items (DLQ + idempotency) moved to Story 4.0 (first Epic 4 story).
#         7P-5 (circuit breaker, alerting, monitoring) can run parallel with Epic 4.
#         7P-1 through 7P-4 can run parallel with Epic 4 but must complete before production.
#         7P-6 and 7P-7 can run anytime before production.

# EPIC 3 RETRO: AGREED EXECUTION ORDER (2026-02-08)
# ===================================================
# This is the team-agreed execution plan from the interactive Epic 3 retrospective:
#   1. ✅ Finalize Epic 3 retrospective (done)
#   2. ❌ Story 3.11 — CANCELLED (party mode 2026-02-08: prompt defines structure, LLM returns markdown, report UI renders it)
#   3. Story MW-1 — Module wiring tests for Epics 1, 2, 3 (new test category) ← NEXT
#   4. Run wiring tests, fix any issues found
#   5. Story 3E update — +4 E2E tests (3 workflow management + 1 file type preset)
#   6. Story 4E — ~12 E2E tests (tenant lifecycle, RBAC/guards, invitations)
#   7. Run full E2E suite, fix any issues found
#   8. Epic 4 — Story 4-0 first (BullMQ DLQ + idempotency)
#
# KEY TEAM AGREEMENTS (new from Epic 3 retro):
#   - Party mode is DEFAULT for every story (planning, post-impl, code review)
#   - Module wiring tests are a standard test category for all epics
#   - Story size limit: max ~60 tests per story
#   - TenantId enforcement: automated grep/CI check + code review checklist
#   - Guard ordering documentation required for every guard
#   - Browser smoke test for every UI story before code review
#   - Story creation must verify actual codebase state
#   - Prompt is single source of truth for workflow output structure

# IMMEDIATE POST-EPIC-2 ACTION:
# =============================
# - Swagger @ApiResponse gap fix: Add missing error response decorators (400, 401, 403, 500)
#   to ALL existing controllers across Epic 1 and Epic 2. Rule added to project-context.md
#   to prevent this gap in all future epics. Must be done before Epic 3 starts.
#   Controllers to fix: AuthController, TenantsController, UsersController,
#   InvitationsController, AssetsController, FoldersController, IngestionController,
#   KnowledgeController, AppController.
#   Raised during Story 2.3 code review (2026-02-01).
#
# FUTURE EPIC CONSIDERATION:
# ==========================
# - Knowledge Base Browsing/Viewing UI: Admin and tenant-facing UI to browse stored
#   RAG data (indexed chunks, embeddings metadata), search the knowledge base interactively,
#   and view per-tenant knowledge health. Could be part of Epic 8 or a new epic.
#   Raised during Story 2.3 creation (2026-02-01).

  # Epic 3.1: Settings & Essentials
  # Foundational infrastructure needed before proceeding
  # Created from Epic 3 retrospective: Settings + Logout
  # Must complete before E2E test stories and Epic 4
  #
  # REWRITTEN 2026-02-05: Original 3.1-1 failed quality review (no codebase
  # verification, scope too large, invented non-existent env vars). Split into
  # 3 properly-scoped stories. Existing LLM model backend (entity, service,
  # controller, DTOs) was not referenced — Story 3.1-3 builds frontend for it.
  #
  # DEFERRED FROM ORIGINAL 3.1-1:
  #   - Test Connection → Epic 4 (needs LLM provider SDK integration)
  #   - Audit Trail → Epic 7 Story 7-2 (cross-cutting concern)
  #   - E2E Tests → Handled by E2E stories (1E/2E/3E)
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  epic-3.1: done # All 4 stories complete (3.1-1 through 3.1-4). 878 total tests, 0 lint errors.
  3.1-1-admin-settings-page-shell: done # REWRITTEN 2026-02-05. Settings page route + tabbed layout + nav link. UI skeleton only.
  3.1-2-logout-avatar-dropdown: done # Avatar dropdown replaces logout in all layouts. GET /api/auth/me + user signal + reusable AvatarDropdownComponent. 28 tests, code review passed (2 rounds).
  3.1-3-llm-model-admin-ui: done # Frontend for existing backend LLM model CRUD. 29 tests, 353 total. Code review passed 2026-02-06.
  3.1-4-provider-credential-storage: done # LlmProviderConfigEntity + encrypted credential storage + CRUD API + Providers tab UI. 70 story tests. Code review: 8 fixes (3H, 3M, 2L). 878 total tests, 0 failures, 0 lint errors.

  # USER TESTING FEEDBACK (2026-02-08 — post-Story-3.9 live session)
  # Captured during hands-on browser testing of the full app.
  # Party mode review completed 2026-02-08.
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  #
  # BUG-1: TEMPLATE RENDERING BROKEN (Settings + Workflow Studio) — FIXED
  #   Root cause: 20 missing Lucide icon registrations in app.config.ts.
  #   Unregistered icons silently broke Angular template rendering.
  #   Fix: commit b30faa3. All icons now registered.
  #
  # BUG-2: EMAIL INVITATIONS FAIL (expected)
  #   Root cause: No SMTP service configured. Expected for local dev.
  #   Target: Epic 7P or production deployment setup.
  #
  # UX-1: FILE TYPE RESTRICTIONS — MANUAL ENTRY TOO TEDIOUS → Story 3.10
  #   Decision: Standalone story (not part of 3.8). Chip-toggle UI with
  #   hardcoded preset groups. Shared constant in libs/shared. ~half day.
  #
  # UX-2: NO PUBLISH UI — covered by Story 3.8 (no separate action needed)
  #
  # FEATURE-1: WORKFLOW TEST RUN & PREVIEW → Story 4.7 (Epic 4)
  #   Decision: Both layout preview (A) and functional test (B) deferred to
  #   Epic 4. The test run form IS the user-facing form — Option A comes free.
  #   Option B requires the execution engine. No throwaway preview UI.
  #
  # BUGS FIXED IN THIS SESSION:
  #   - tenant_id → tenantId mismatch in 8 controllers (commit 74ab37a)
  #   - SET LOCAL parameterized query → string interpolation with UUID validation
  #   - Role tooltip clarified (Subject vs Context)
  #   - 20 missing Lucide icons registered (commit b30faa3)
