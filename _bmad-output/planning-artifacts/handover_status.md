# Project Bubble - Session Handover Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18
**Current Agent:** Antigravity (Lead Architect/Planner)

## 📍 Where We Are
We have completed the **Implementation Readiness Check** for the project. The result was **NEEDS WORK** due to critical gaps in UX and specific functional stories.

We have agreed on a **Refinement Plan** (`task.md`) to fix these issues before writing code.

### ✅ Completed
1.  **Workflow Initialization:** Project set to `greenfield` / `bmad-method`.
2.  **Readiness Assessment:** Analyzed PRD, Architecture, and Epics.
3.  **Refinement Plan:** Created `task.md` and swapped phases (Fix Gaps 1st -> UX 2nd).

## 🚦 Current Status
**Active Phase:** Phase 1 - Structural Integrity (Fixing Epic Gaps)
**Goal:** Add missing stories to `epics.md` for PDF Export, Execution Traces, and Seeding.

## 🚀 How to Resume
If the session crashes, start a new chat and paste:

> "Status check: We are in the 'Refinement Phase'. Review `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/handover_status.md` and `task.md`. We were about to execute Phase 1 (Fixing Epic Gaps). Please pick up from there."
