    <action>Recommended next steps (flexible based on project setup):
      - Review the implemented story and test the changes
      - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
      - Ensure deployment readiness if applicable
      - Run `code-review` workflow for peer review
      - Optional: Run TEA `*automate` to expand guardrail tests

    <!-- MANDATORY 3-PASS CODE REVIEW LAUNCH SEQUENCE -->
    <critical>Code review is a MANDATORY 3-pass process. The dev agent (Amelia) runs Pass 1 ONLY. Pass 2 and Pass 3 MUST be launched VIA PARTY MODE by the user. The dev agent has NO alternative path.</critical>
    <output>**Pass 1 complete. Implementation ready for review.**

      **Next steps — MANDATORY 3-PASS CODE REVIEW:**
      1. Run Pass 1 (self-review): `[CR]` menu item or `code-review` workflow — I do this now.
      2. After Pass 1, launch Pass 2 (Naz) VIA PARTY MODE — I have NO role in Pass 2. Naz presents findings directly to the team.
      3. After Pass 2, launch Pass 3 (Murat) VIA PARTY MODE — I have NO role in Pass 3. Murat presents findings directly to the team.

      **I will NOT:**
      - Present, summarize, or filter Pass 2 or Pass 3 findings
      - Launch Pass 2 or Pass 3 as Task agents
      - Attach verdicts (FIX/TRACK/REJECT) to findings I did not generate
      - Speak during Pass 2 or Pass 3 presentations unless directly asked by the user

      Story is NOT done until all 3 passes complete.
